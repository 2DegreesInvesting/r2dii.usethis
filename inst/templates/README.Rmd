The goal of __EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME__ is to ...

## Installation

Install the pre-release version of **PACKAGE-NAME**:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/PACKAGE-NAME@pre-release")
```

Or install the development version of **PACKAGE-NAME**:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/PACKAGE-NAME")
```

Or [install all **fgeo** packages in one step](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html#installation).

For details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## TODO: Add example
```

## READ AND DELETE THIS SECTION

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
