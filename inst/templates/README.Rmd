```
# In .travis.yml consider adding `warnings_are_errors: false`
# IMPORTANT (to avoid errors due to low limit rate):
# Get GITHUB_PAT with usethis::edit_r_environ() and set it as environmental 
# variablel on travis (see https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/learn/issues/148)
use_travis()

## READ AND DELETE THIS SECTION

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
